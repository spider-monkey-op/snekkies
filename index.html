            The fog has risen from the sea and crowned<br>
            The dark, untrodden summits of the coast,<br>
            Where roams a voice, in canyons uttermost,<br>
            From midnight waters vibrant and profound.<br>
            High on each granite altar dies the sound,<br>
            Deep as the trampling of an armored host,<br>
            Lone as the lamentation of a ghost,<br>
            Sad as the diapason of the drowned.<br>
            <br>
            The mountain seems no more a soulless thing,<br>
            But rather as a shape of ancient fear,<br>
            In darkness and the winds of Chaos born<br>
            Amid the lordless heavens’ thundering–<br>
            A Presence crouched, enormous and austere,<br>
            Before whose feet the mighty waters mourn.</div>
